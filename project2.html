  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    Developed a C program for a course that simulates customers arriving at multiple movie ticket lines and being processed by several booths. 
    The program reads customer data from a file, assigns each customer to one of twelve queues using linked lists, and processes them based on earliest arrival time. 
    Checkout times are calculated using a fixed base time plus additional time per ticket, demonstrating effective use of 
    structs, pointers, file I/O, queue data structures, and dynamic memory management.
