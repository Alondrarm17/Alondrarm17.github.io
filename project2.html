  <h1>Project 2 – Movie Line (C Program)</h1>

  <p>
    Built a C program for COP3502C that simulates customers arriving to multiple
    movie ticket lines and being processed by multiple booths. The program reads input
    from a file, assigns customers to lines, and prints the checkout time for each customer.
  </p>

  <h2>What the program does</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Reads number of customers and booths from an input file</li>
    <li>Assigns customers to one of 12 lines using a rule based on the first letter of their name</li>
    <li>Uses linked-list queues to model each line</li>
    <li>Processes customers by earliest arrival time across assigned lines per booth</li>
    <li>Computes checkout time using: <strong>30 + (tickets × 5)</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Skills used</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>C programming</li>
    <li>Structs and pointers</li>
    <li>Linked lists & queues</li>
    <li>File I/O and parsing</li>
    <li>Debugging and memory management</li>
  </ul>
